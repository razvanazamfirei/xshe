`xshe` allows for setting <u>Sh</u>ell <u>E</u>nvironment Variables across multiple shells with a single TOML configuration file.

Simply write lines in a `xshe.toml` file like this:

```toml
CARGO_HOME = "~/.cargo"
```

Create a file like this once and use it everywhere, for every shell! `xshe` can convert this format into the format for every supported shell.

## Installation

You can install `xshe` from [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) (Rust's package manager) if you have it installed on your system.
If you don't have Cargo or don't want to use it,
you can also [download the binaries for your system](https://github.com/superatomic/xshe/releases/latest) directly from GitHub,
or [install Cargo/Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) first before proceeding.

**Note:** After installing `xshe`, you might have to add the resulting `xshe` binary to your `PATH`.
[<sup>(what's that?)</sup>](https://askubuntu.com/questions/551990/what-does-path-mean)

### With Cargo

Install [`xshe`](https://crates.io/crates/xshe) from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/xshe) with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

```shell
cargo install -f xshe
```

### As a File Download

Instead of using Cargo, you can download the [**latest release binary**](https://github.com/superatomic/xshe/releases/latest) that corresponds with your system
(or view [**all releases**](https://github.com/superatomic/xshe/releases)).

Make sure to add the `xshe` binary to your `PATH`,
or remember to use the full path to the binary whenever you run `xshe`.

## Setup

### Creating a `xshe.toml` file

Create a file called `xshe.toml` in `~/.config`. This is a [TOML file](https://toml.io/en/) that represents environment variables.

[![An example configuration is here: xshe example](https://custom-icon-badges.herokuapp.com/badge/Example-xshe.toml-blue?labelColor=blue&color=lightblue&logo=file&logoColor=white)](https://gist.github.com/superatomic/8f22ada9864c85984d51e0cc6fae4250)

One variable is set per line. The file is read in order from top to bottom,
so variables that appear earlier in the file can be used to define ones that appear later.

A typical line looks like this:

```toml
CARGO_HOME = "$XDG_DATA_HOME/cargo"
```

This will then be converted into the correct format for whatever shell is being used.
For example, in **bash**, this line becomes:

```bash
export CARGO_HOME="$XDG_DATA_HOME/cargo";
```
While in **fish**, this line is:
```fish
set -gx CARGO_HOME "$XDG_DATA_HOME/cargo";
```

#### Dealing with `PATH` variables

To set variables that are arrays of values, like `$PATH`, use this syntax:

```toml
PATH = ["$PATH", "$BIN_HOME", "$CARGO_HOME/bin"]
```
`xshe` will join each element together based on the shell that is specified.

#### Shell Specific Environment Variables

To set environment variables for only one shell, add a new table called `[shell.NAME]` after all standard definitions,
where `NAME` is on of `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`.
Then list the environment variables that will only be added if `xshe` is being used for the given shell.

For example, to make `$HISTFILE` be different between shells and `$ZSH_CACHE_DIR` only be set in **zsh**, do this:
```toml
[shell.bash]
HISTFILE = "$XDG_STATE_HOME/bash_history"

[shell.zsh]
HISTFILE = "$XDG_STATE_HOME/zsh_history"
ZSH_CACHE_DIR = "$XDG_CACHE_HOME/oh-my-zsh"
```

### Sourcing the `xshe.toml` file

Put the line corresponding to your shell in whatever file runs when loading environment variables.
For **bash**, this is `~/.bash_profile`, for **zsh**, this is `~/.zshenv`, and for **fish**, this is `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.

##### Bash
```bash
eval "$(xshe bash)"
```

##### Zsh
```zsh
eval "$(xshe zsh)"
```

##### Fish
```fish
eval "$(xshe fish)"
```

#### Use without `xshe` on `PATH`
If `xshe` isn't on your `PATH` (this is the cause of the error `command not found: xshe`), you will have to manually type out the location:

```zsh
eval "$(/path/to/xshe zsh)"
```

#### Options

##### Using `--file` (or `-f`)

To specify a custom file that is not located at `~/.config/xshe.toml`, pass the `--file` option, like so:

```zsh
eval "$(xshe zsh --file ~/some/other/location.toml)"
```

##### Using `--toml` (or `-t`)

To directly specify TOML to parse as a config file, use `--toml`.

For example, this line directly parses the provided line and converts it to zsh:
```zsh
xshe zsh --toml 'BIN_HOME = "$HOME/.local/bin"'
```
