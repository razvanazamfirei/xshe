**Xshe** allows for setting <u>Sh</u>ell <u>E</u>nvironment Variables across multiple shells with a single TOML
configuration file.

Instead of writing multiple similar files for each shell you use,
you can instead create one file and use it for every shell with **xshe**!

All you have to do is [add a single line](docs/cli.md#sourcing-the-xshetoml-file) to all of your shells' startup scripts,
and `xshe` will set your environment variable across all of them.

To use **xshe**, you write lines in a `xshe.toml` file like this _(in [TOML] format)_:

```toml
CARGO_HOME = "~/.cargo"
EDITOR = "$(which nano)"
```

Create a file like this once and use it everywhere, for every shell!
`xshe` can convert this into the format for every supported shell.
